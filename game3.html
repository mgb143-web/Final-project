      <h2>Persona 5/ Persona 5 Royal</h2>
      <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Role-play/Story</p>
      <p><strong>Why I like it:</strong></p>
        <p>
            Persona 5 is a role-playing game where you play as a high
            school student in Tokyo who secretly lives a double life
            as a Phantom Thief. In the daytime, you go to school, 
            answer questions, take exams, and hang out around the city.
            At night, you and your friends sneak into a supernatural 
            world to fight enemies and change the hearts of corrupt adults.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The game mixes daily life sim and turn-based combat. You 
            explore “Palaces,” which are dungeons based on a villain&apos;s 
            twisted mind, like a castle, museum, bank, cruise ship, and 
            casino. In battle, you summon Personas (spirit-like beings)
            to use elemental attacks, hit enemy weaknesses, and trigger
            All-Out Attacks. Outside of combat, you choose how to spend
            your time: building relationships with Confidants, doing
            part-time jobs, and raising social stats, which unlock new abilities and bonuses.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I like Persona 5 so much because it has a stylish look, a strong story,
            and a cool Phantom Thief theme that makes you feel like a rebel fighting
            for justice. The music is catchy, the characters feel real and memorable,
            and the mix of school life and dungeon crawling keeps things from getting
            boring. It&apos;s one of those games where I actually care about the
            characters and want to see what happens next.
        </p>
