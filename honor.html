          <h3>Sonic Colors</h3>
          <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Action Platformer</p>
          <p><strong>Info:</strong> Released in 2010 for the Nintendo Wii and Nintendo DS by SEGA</p>
          <p><strong>What is it?:</strong>
            Sonic Colors is a fast-paced platformer where you play 
            as Sonic the Hedgehog trying to stop Dr. Eggman from using 
            an interstellar amusement park to capture and control alien
            creatures called Wisps. The game focuses on high-speed running,
            quick reactions, and colorful environments, mixing 2D and 3D 
            sections as you dash through each level.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The stages are split into different themed areas of Eggman&apos;s 
            space park, like a tropical resort, a candy-themed world, a 
            rollercoaster-like asteroid zone, and more. Each area has 
            multiple acts, with lots of alternate paths and secrets.
            A big feature is the Wisps: special power-ups that give 
            Sonic abilities like turning into a laser to zip through
            lines of rings, drilling through the ground, or rocketing
            straight up. These mechanics encourage replaying levels to find 
            new routes and collectables.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            I like Sonic Colors because it&apos;s bright, fun, and satisfying 
            when you&apos;re boosting through levels and chaining Wisp powers 
            together. The music and visuals give it a really happy, 
            energetic vibe. It didn&apos;t make my top 6, though, because
            while I enjoy it a lot, I feel more attached to other 
            games that have deeper stories, more replay value, or 
            stronger memories for me. So it&apos;s still a game I think 
            is great, just more of an honorable mention compared to 
            my absolute favorites.

          <h3>Mario Party 9</h3>
          <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Fun Party Game</p>
          <p><strong>Info:</strong> Released in 2012 for the Nintendo Wii by Nintendo</p>
          <p><strong>What is it?:</strong> 
            Mario Party 9 is a party game where you play mini-games and
            move around a game board with Mario characters like Mario, 
            Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, and more. Instead of everyone moving 
            separately like older Mario Party games, all players ride 
            together in a vehicle, taking turns as the captain and trying 
            to collect the most Mini Stars by the end of the board.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The stages are different themed boards, like a grassy starter area,
            a spooky haunted board, a lava-filled volcano, and a space-themed map. 
            Each board has its own events, hazards, and boss battles where everyone
            works together to fight a big enemy but still competes for points. The
            game includes lots of mini-games that test things like timing, luck, 
            and quick reactions, and there are special spaces on the board that 
            can help you, hurt you, or steal stars from other players. The shared 
            car mechanic and boss fights are the big features that make Mario Party
            9 feel different from the earlier games.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            I like Mario Party 9 because it&apos;s fun, looks colorful, and the mini-games
            are a good mix of simple and competitive, so it&apos;s easy to play with friends
            or family. The boss battles and the way everyone rides in the same vehicle
            keep the game moving and create funny, chaotic moments. It didn&apos;t make my
            top 6, though, because I still prefer the older Mario Party style where 
            everyone moves on their own and collects regular Stars, and some of those
            games feel more classic and memorable to me. So Mario Party 9 is still 
            an enjoyable party game I&apos;m glad I played, but it fits better as an honorable mention.
