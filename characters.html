        <h3>Mario</h3>
        <p class="bio">Mario is a heroic plumber from the Mushroom Kingdom 
          and the main mascot of Nintendo. He first appeared in 1981 in the
          arcade game Donkey Kong, where he was called “Jumpman” and worked
          as a carpenter before later being reimagined as a plumber. He&apos;s a 
          cheerful character with a red hat and overalls, and his main role 
          in most games is to protect the Mushroom Kingdom and rescue Princess 
          Peach from villains like Bowser by running, jumping, and using
          power-ups to save the day.</p>

        <h3>Wolf</h3>
        <p class="bio">Wolf is a space pilot and the leader of Star Wolf
           in the Star Fox series. He&apos;s usually portrayed as Fox McCloud&apos;s 
           rival and sometimes an enemy, working as a mercenary rather than a hero. 
           His role is often to oppose Star Fox in space battles, leading his own team 
           in dogfights and missions that clash with Fox&apos;s goals.</p>

        <h3>Bowser Jr.</h3>
        <p class="bio">Bowser Jr. is the son of Bowser in the Mario series and often
           acts as one of Mario&apos;s main enemies. He helps his father kidnap Princess
           Peach, causes trouble across different worlds, and uses gadgets like his
           Junior Clown Car, paintbrush, and various machines. His role is usually
           to act as a boss or mini-boss, backing up Bowser and trying to stop Mario 
           from reaching the end.</p>

        <h3>Shadow</h3>
          <p class="bio">Shadow the Hedgehog is an anti-hero from the Sonic series,
            created as the “Ultimate Life Form.” He has a darker personality than 
            Sonic and often struggles between doing what&apos;s right and following his
            own path or past promises. His role usually involves using Chaos Control
            and his speed to fight strong threats, sometimes working against Sonic
            and sometimes teaming up with him when the world is in danger.</p>

        <h3>Meta Knight</h3>
        <p class="bio">Meta Knight is a mysterious sword-wielding warrior from 
          the Kirby series who usually wears a mask and cape. He often appears as 
          a rival or test for Kirby, challenging him in battle to see if he&apos;s strong 
          enough, but he&apos;s not purely evil. His role shifts between opponent and 
          ally, sometimes leading his ship, the Halberd, into action and other times 
          helping Kirby face bigger threats.</p>

        <h3>Machamp</h3>
        <p class="bio">Machamp is a Fighting-type Pokémon known for its four
         muscular arms and powerful physical strength. It often appears as a 
         strong, close-combat battler that excels in punching and grappling moves. 
         Its role in battles is to act as a tough front-line fighter, using its
        strength to overpower opponents and take on heavy hits in return.</p>
