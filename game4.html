      <h2>Super Mario 3D World</h2>
      <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Platforming story game</p>
      <p><strong>Why I like it:</strong></p>
      <p>
        Super Mario 3D World is a 3D platformer where you play as Mario, Luigi,
        Peach, or Toad and run through classic-style levels in a 3D space. 
        Instead of one huge open world, you move along a world map and enter
        small, focused stages that each have their own gimmick or idea.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The game has themed worlds like grassy plains, deserts, snow lands, 
        haunted houses, beaches, and lava castles. Levels are packed with secrets,
        Green Stars, and stamps to collect. One of the big features is the Cat Suit
        power-up, which lets you climb walls, swipe at enemies, and do a diving pounce. 
        Each character plays a bit differently.Luigi jumps higher, Peach can hover, etc.And 
        up to four people can play together locally, which makes the stages feel chaotic and fun.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        I like Super Mario 3D World so much because it&apos;s bright, creative, and
        relaxing to play, but still has challenging bonus levels if I want a tougher
        experience. The Cat Suit makes moving around feel really fun, and the short
        stages are perfect when I just want to play a bit without committing to
        a long session. It&apos;s also great with friends or family, with everyone 
        running around, bumping into each other, and yelling when someone accidentally throws 
        another person off a ledge.
