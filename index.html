          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
            I&apos;m a lifelong gamer who spends way too many hours exploring new worlds, 
            experimenting with all kinds of genres, and paying attention to the small
            details most people skip over things like level design, sound effects, enemy patterns,
            and how the story connects to the gameplay. I love jumping from cozy single-player
            adventures to intense multiplayer matches and then going back to older 
            games to see how graphics, controls, difficulty, and game mechanics have changed over the years.
          </p>
          <p>
            I&apos;ve played everything from long, story-heavy RPGs that pull you in for hundreds
            of hours to fast-paced competitive shooters where every round feels different, plus 
            indie games, platformers, and party games I&apos;ve shared with friends. Over time 
            I&apos;ve built up a huge list of favorites, screenshots, clips, and characters 
            that really stuck with me, so this site is my way of putting all of that in one
            place showing the games I care about, explaining what makes them stand out to me,
            and giving people a peek at the moments and memories I&apos;ve collected while playing.
          </p>
          <p>
            I ranked each game by looking at a few different things instead of just asking “which
            one is the most fun.” I thought about gameplay first how the game feels to actually 
            play, like controls, mechanics, and how satisfying it is moment to moment. I also 
            looked at stages and level design, paying attention to how creative, memorable, and 
            varied the areas are. Another big factor was replay value: how often I want to come
            back, whether there are extra modes, collectibles, or reasons to keep playing. I 
            also considered the characters, music, and overall style or vibe of each game, 
            since those can make a huge difference in how much I connect with it. Finally, 
            I thought about personal memories, how each game made me feel, who I played it with,
            and how strong my attachment is. All of that together helped me decide which games
            made the top 6 and which ones ended up as honorable mentions.
