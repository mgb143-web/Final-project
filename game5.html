      <h2>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</h2>
      <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Fighting</p>
      <p><strong>Why I like it:</strong></p>
        <p>
            Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is a fighting game where characters from tons 
            of different video game series battle each other on stages based on their home games. 
            Instead of using health bars, you try to knock your opponents off the stage by hitting 
            them and raising their damage percentage.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The game has a huge roster of 89 fighters, including Mario, Link, Pikachu,
            Kirby, Sonic, Cloud, Joker from Persona 5, and many more. Each character has
            unique moves and playstyles, so learning them feels different every time. 
            The stages are like arenas based on different games, Pokémon Stadium,
            Hyrule-type stages, Mario worlds, sci-fi platforms, and more with platforms,
            hazards, and sometimes changing layouts. There&apos;s also World of Light, a 
            story mode where most fighters are captured and you travel across a big map,
            doing themed spirit battles to free them.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I like Smash Ultimate so much because it never gets old. There are so many
            characters and stages that every match feels a little different. It&apos;s
            perfect for playing with friends, whether we want serious 1v1 fights or
            crazy items-on, 4-player chaos. Even when I&apos;m alone, World of
            Light and the huge roster give me a lot to do and experiment with, 
            so I always feel like there&apos;s someone new to learn or a new combo to try.
        </p>
