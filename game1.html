      <h2>Splatoon 3</h2>
      <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Third-Person Shooter</p>
      <p><strong>Why I like it:</strong></p>
      <p>
        Splatoon 3 is a fast-paced third-person shooter where players use ink instead of bullets,
        and that twist is what makes it feel completely different from other games.
        You&apos;re not just trying to eliminate players, you&apos;re trying to cover the map
        with your team&apos;s color, move through your own ink faster, and outplay opponents
        using creative weapons like rollers, dualies, and chargers. The game is fun
        because every match feels chaotic and energetic, and no two battles play
        out the same way. The movement, the colors, the style, and the constant 
        back-and-forth for map control make the game feel alive, and it builds that 
        “one more match” feeling every time you play.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        I also play Splatoon 3 competitively, which adds another level of
        excitement to the game. In comp, you&apos;re not just playing for
        fun, you&apos;re analyzing maps, learning team compositions, 
        working on positioning, and practicing callouts with teammates.
        Every mistake matters, every push matters, and every big play
        feels way more rewarding. Playing competitively pushes me to
        understand the game deeper, especially things like weapon 
        matchups, specials, and rotations. It&apos;s also a great 
        feeling when all the practice pays off and you clutch a
        team fight or make the right decision in overtime.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The story modes in Splatoon 3 add even more to the experience.
        The main story, “Return of the Mammalians,” lets you explore
        different test-like levels while uncovering what&apos;s happening
        with the Octarians and the sudden return of fuzzy enemies.
        It mixes platforming, puzzle-like challenges, and boss fights
        in a way that teaches you new mechanics without feeling like
        a tutorial. The Side Order DLC focuses on a different style 
        of gameplay, a roguelike run where you climb the Spire of
        Order, power up your character with color chips, and try 
        to break out of a washed-out, colorless world. Both modes
        show different sides of Splatoon&apos;s universe and give you
        something fun to do outside of multiplayer while still 
        keeping the same style and creativity the series is known for.
