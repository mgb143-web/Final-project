      <h2>Overwatch/ Overwatch 2</h2>
      <p><strong>Genre:</strong>First-Person Shooter</p>
      <p><strong>Why I like it:</strong></p>
        <p>
            Overwatch is a team-based first-person shooter where two teams
            compete in 6v6 or 5v5 matches (depending on the version) to complete
            objectives like capturing control points or escorting a payload.
            Instead of everyone playing the same kind of soldier, you pick
            from a roster of heroes, each with their own weapon, abilities, and role.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Heroes are divided into roles like Damage, Tank, and Support.
            Damage heroes focus on eliminations, Tanks protect the team 
            and create space, and Supports heal and boost allies. 
            Each map has a different layout and mode,some are control
            maps, some are payload escort maps, and some are hybrids.
            Maps are set in different locations around the world, like
            futuristic cities, snowy villages, or desert ruins. Every 
            hero has an ultimate ability that charges over time and can 
            change the flow of a fight when used well.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I like Overwatch so much because the heroes all feel unique, 
            so switching characters can completely change how the game plays.
            The focus on teamwork makes wins feel really satisfying, 
            especially when everyone coordinates their abilities and ultimates.
            Matches are fast and exciting, and it&apos;s especially fun when I&apos;m
            playing with friends, calling out plays and trying different team 
            comps until something clicks.
        </p>
